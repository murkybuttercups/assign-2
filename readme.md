# The Pouch
This artifact was purchased from John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll in 1887. At the time of acquisition, this pouch was not initially registered, and was thought to be found in either Montana or Alberta. The pouch was crafted by the Blackfoot nation, and used skin (hide), porcupine quill, metal, and glass. This type of simply designed pouch was used as an everyday item for utilitarian purposes. Oftentimes the complexity or type of decorations used on pouches were used a symbol by Blackfoot men of how well they were taken care of by their wives.

The **blue glass beads** were used to represent the sky or water. This type of design was often used for someone who had a connection with water.

The **yellow glass beads** were used to represent the sun.

The **red glass beads** were often used as a common decoration.

# The Fringe
**The fringe**, placed on the side, was commonly used as a decoration for the pouch.

# Project Details #
For this project, we were given the opportunity to work with a model of a pouch made by the Blackfoot people. When researching, we found that there was little information on this pouch, so we choose to focus on the materials and design specifically. Creating hotspots to target parts of the model and providing additional information was extremely important to us when creating our user experience. When working with the design of the page, we wanted the transition from the Blackfoot Digital Library website to ours to feel seamless. Therefore, we focused our energy on obtaining assets and similar typography to the Blackfoot Digital Library. We also felt implementing buttons for instructions and simple commands was an effective way to communicate essential information without taking away visual space. While planning, we chose to play to each group members strengths. Brett was in charge of working with three.js/webGL/Javascript, Sara was in charge of design, and Jason was in charge of research and CSS/HTML tweaks.
Our main goal was to represent the pouch as the centerpiece and to allow the user to interact with it and understand it's history and design in full.
